# vance-s3-source
Vance-s3-source is an image-based connector. It receives AWS S3 events, transforms them into CloudEvents, and delivers those CloudEvents to specific targets. Anyone who are interested in S3 events can use this connector without caring about interaction with S3, while output CloudEvents can describe events in a common way.
